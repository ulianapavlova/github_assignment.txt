The project I am looking at was developed by The New York Times news division team and they build a tool which tracks FOIAs filed in the newsroom to avoid duplications by reporters, editors etc. Reporters and editors also get email and Slack notifications on the progress of their FOIA requests. Newsroom lawyers also get to see what data reporters are filing for. I looked at some of the Python code and right now it doesn't mean much to me. I noticed a mention of Django which was a term I saw a few times but didn't what it means. Google results said that Django is web framework, written in Python, which follows the model-view-template agricultural pattern. I noticed == sign which you explained on Monday, in this code it gave a function that if someone's name would equal to main something, something would happen. I also noticed that a code with # sign would give developer's explanation on what to do if an error happens. The program needed to import Django and the error message would address if it was done incorrectly.
